                    Hi! I'm Pallab. I just completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                    I've been heavily involved in the Illini Solar Car team for the past 3 years, have worked on numerous projects and held a variety of leadership positions (most notably the Mechanical Lead).
                    Additionally, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Ewoldt Research Group where I researched embedded 3-D printing. <br><br>
                    These experiences have given me a strong foundation in design, analysis, testing, manufacturing and assembly. I enjoy seeing projects through from start to finish and have gained a deeper appreciation
                    for the omnipresence of mechanical engineering in the world around me. <br><br>
                    My website is still a work in progress, but please feel free to check out my resume and portfolio to see the kinds of work I've done!
                    I look forward to applying my skills to advance innovation and make the world a better place :)
