                        </h2>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Pallab, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                        Over the past three years, I've been deeply involved with the <a href="https://www.illinisolarcar.com/" target="_blank">Illini Solar Car</a> team, where I worked on a wide range of projects and held multiple leadership roles—most notably as Mechanical Lead. 
                        I've also conducted undergraduate research with the <a href="https://ewoldt.mechanical.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Ewoldt Research Group</a>, focusing on embedded 3D printing. <br><br>
                        Through these experiences, I've developed a strong foundation in design, analysis, testing, manufacturing, and assembly. 
                        I enjoy seeing projects through from concept to completion and have gained a deep appreciation for how mechanical engineering shapes the world around us.<br><br>
                        My website is still a work in progress, but feel free to explore my resume and portfolio to learn more about the projects I've worked on. 
                        I'm excited to apply my skills to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact.</p>

                            <h4>Overview:</h4>
                            <p>Redesign an overbuilt suspension to save mass without sacrificing safety. The previous design was not optimized and used large fasteners that were expensive and made servicing challening.
                                Additionally, the previous design broke down during the race so we had to come up with a quick solution on-the-fly!

                            <p>40% weight reduction. Completed on a tight timeline (1 month). Min FoS = 1.28</p>

                            <h4>Overview:</h4>
                            <p>
                                This was my Senior Capstone Project sponsored by thyssenkrupp. We were asked to improve a section of a cam lobe autofeeder that currently undergoes large amounts of downtime. 
                                Since the current machine vision system was not very reliable, we proposed four solutions and produced high-fidelity prototypes for each:
                            </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Narrowing conveyor using an industrial vibrator to prevent jamming.</li>
                                    <li>Roller bearing gripper to mechanically force the lobes into 1 of 2 positions.</li>
                                    <li>Updated machine vision system.</li>
                                    <li>Poka yoke to account for any final misalignment.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>
                                My contributions focused on the conveyor and gripper systems, as well as creating a high-fidelity test setup for rapid off-site prototyping.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Outcome:</h4>
                            <p>Projected 99% uptime. Reduced cycle time by ~0.5 s. Proposed solutions successfully passed 1000+ tests on high-fidelity prototype. Won 2nd place for best prototype.</p>

                            <p>
                                In Illini Solar Car, we use composites to make any part we can! The goal is to make components with a high stiffness-to-weight ratio. 
                                I've gotten all kinds of experience by working with composites - design, analysis, testing, layups. 
                                Whenever I do research about composites I end up in 20 different rabbit holes which always reminds me there's so much to learn :)

                                Researched and documented ASTM testing procedure for future generations.
                                Performed shear, bending and tensile tests on 50+ coupons to maximize stiffness-to-weight ratio of final laminate.

                            <h4>Overview:</h4>
                            <p>
                                This was another project for our mechanical design class. We had to create an RC Car (without steering) that could shift gears with just 1 servo.
                                I first determined the gear ratios required, then performed stress analysis on the gear teeth, and lastly designed the shifting mechanism using a barrel cam.
                                We needed a low speed (high torque), high speed and reverse gear to complete all the challenges.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Skills Used:</h4>
                            <p>Hand Calcs (Stress Analysis), Drivetrain Design, Mechanisms, Electronics - Arduino, Motor, Motor Driver, IR Remote and Sensor</p>

                                Lifted 4.5 kg up a 20 degree incline (2 kg was the requirement). Met the speed requirement. 
                                The shifter was unreliable so we only got half points for the shifting challenge.

                                The goal for this project was to create an robot that can walk up a 30 degree slope on grassy/muddy terrain at a minimum speed of 4 m/min.
